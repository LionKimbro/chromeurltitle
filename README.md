# Chrome URL Title

## Welcome


```
Project Title: Chrome URL 

Project Summary: a chrome extension & local Python listener for
                 getting a URL and title out of the web browser
```

This is a little project that consists of two parts:

1. A Python server, called "bookmarkreceiver", that receives JSON containing a TITLE and URL for a web page.
2. A Google Chrome extension, "TITLE & URL Sharing Extension", that emits JSON containing a TITLE and URL for the current web page.


What I wanted was to be able to integrate bookmarking behaviors in my life, with my own digital storage systems.

I wanted to be able to do so in real-time, and I wanted to tightly control the process.

So I wrote this.

Feel free to adapt it, however you like.
