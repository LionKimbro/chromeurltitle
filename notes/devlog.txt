  I've relocated the project from trigger, into the factory system;
  I've had to do quite a bit of work to get it structured for git
  and Python packages.

  It shouldn't work -- and it's totally untested, in its new form.


  Things I need to do:

  LEARN
  [ ] How do config files typically work in a Python ecology
      based on pip install?

  VERIFY
  [ ] Verify that the chrome extension still works,
      is side-loadable into chrome, yadda yadda yadda.

  IMPLEMENT
  [ ] Factory system:
      I need to set up the hot key environment for working on
      devlog.txt and notes.txt in EMACS.

  [ ] Factory system:
      TRIGGER.json

  [ ] Make sure that the server can be run, and that the
      configuration file system makes sense, whatever it is.
